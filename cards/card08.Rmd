**Subject:** You have reached the goal for PONV 03

Dear Dr. Shaw,

Your performance, `r numerator`/`r denominator`, for the measure, [postoperative nausea and vomiting](https://mpog.org/files/quality/measures/ponv-03_spec.pdf) (PONV 03), was below the goal of 90% (`r scaled_goal`/`r denominator`).

\  

Sincerely,

The MPOG Quality Team
